## What is the Colosseum?

<p>Colosseum is a discussion community that exchanges opinions from light topics to social issues.</p>

<p>You can login with Kakao social login.</p>

<p>Before discussion, You should vote pro or con</p>

<p>Then, you can leave your opinions that show others by realtime</p>

<p>But, you can't reverse that you voted</p>

<p>You can use abusive language and use violent language</p>

<p>But keep in mind that such a figure may doubt the authenticity and professionalism of what you voted for, and furthermore, that your figure may represent the opinion you voted for</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy the discussion in a well-mannered and sophisticated way</p>

<p>THANK YOU</p>
